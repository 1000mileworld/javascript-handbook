// What exactly is the DOM?
// The official definition is that it’s a programming API for documents.
// It’s the bridge between your HTML and JavaScript

// When you have an HTML page, each HTML tag is turned into a JavaScript object by the browser
// Each of the objects is stored inside the DOM
// You can think about it as the document being a tree and each node in the tree is created from those HTML tags.

// The document is at the top, or root of the tree
// And then it's first children are the head and the body and then each of those have the children title each one UL etc..
