// The document is at the top, or root of the tree
// And then it's first children are the head and the body and then each of those have the children title each one UL etc..

// If you enter ‘document’ into the console, it returns an object
// This is not a normal JavaScript object, rather an HTML-like representation of the nodes on the page.

// Instead, run console.dir(document), and you get a more familiar looking JavaScript Object: 
// And if you go to the body dropdown, and then click childNodes, you will be able to see all the child nodes for the page
  
// Don't be intimidated by the very long list!
// This is just important to know so you can see that the DOM is just a glorified JavaScript object and it's made from the HTML on your page.
