// Change a submit button to have a background colou of red
const button = document.querySelector('.btn');
button.style.background = 'red';

// Why use this? Why not just CSS?
// We can use JavaScript and use events and functions and make this dynamic
// For example, click on one thing and have the color on something else change, or size, etc.
// But be careful of Separation of Concerns
