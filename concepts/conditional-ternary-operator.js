// TERNARY OPERATOR (short hand if statement)
// Is used a lot to assign variables based on a condition
// The ternary operator is represented by the ? operator, and stands for 'then'
// The : operators represents 'else'
// Change the value of the 'd' variable to see different results
const d = 16;
const color = d > 10 ? 'red' : 'blue'; // try removing all of this and just have color = 'green'
console.log(color);

// The operators reads as
// Is d greater than 10?
// If so, then color is assigned value of red
// Else, assigned the value of blue
