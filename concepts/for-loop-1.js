// FOR LOOP
// You pass in 3 parameters: 
// 1) the assignment of the iterator/variable 
// 2) the condition that needs to be met
// 3) the increment (or decrement)
// And whatever is placed inside the { } will run until true
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

// You can also use backticks
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(`The index location of this for loop is ${i}`);
