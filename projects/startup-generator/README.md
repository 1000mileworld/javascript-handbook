# Startup Generator
This is just a simple project/resource I came up with that you can use to create a randomly generated startup idea. Feel free to [Tweet](https://twitter.com/andrew_devsrc) me your projects once their all done, or any crazy combinations you get!

With this project I also learned how to setup ESLint and Prettier.


### Things I learnt building this project
- How to setup ESLint and Prettier
- Setting up a basic addEventListener using an arrow function
- How to generate a random number
- Using template strings to display the output message using innerHTML.
